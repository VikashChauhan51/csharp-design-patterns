# C# Design Patterns
Every developer strives to write maintainable, readable, and reusable code. Code structuring becomes more important as applications become larger. Design patterns prove crucial to solving this challenge - providing an organization structure for common issues in a particular circumstance.

## Categories Of Design Pattern
Design patterns can be broken down into a number of different categories. In this section weâ€™ll review three of these categories and briefly mention a few examples of the patterns that fall into these categories before exploring specific ones in more detail.

### Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitable for the situation we're working in. The basic approach to object creation might otherwise lead to added complexity in a project whilst these patterns aim to solve this problem by controlling the creation process.

#### Examples of Creational Design Pattern:
The following design patterns belong to the Creational Design pattern category.

1. Singleton Design Pattern
2. Factory Design Pattern
3. Abstract Factory Design Pattern
4. Builder Design Pattern
5. Fluent Interface Design Pattern
6. Prototype Design Pattern

### Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to do the same. They also assist in recasting parts of the system which don't fit a particular purpose into those that do.

In other words, Structural patterns are used for object made up.

#### Examples of Structural Design Patterns in C#:
1. Adapter Design Pattern
2. Facade Design Pattern
3. Decorator Design Pattern
4. Bridge Design Pattern
5. Composite Design Pattern
6. Proxy Design Pattern
7. Flyweight Design Pattern

### Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus on improving or streamlining the communication between disparate objects in a system.

#### Examples of Behavioral Design Pattern in C#:
1. Iterator Design Pattern
2. Observer Design Pattern
3. Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
4. Interpreter Design Pattern
5. Command Design Pattern
6. Memento Design Pattern
7. Mediator Design Pattern
8. State Design Pattern
9. Template Method Design Pattern
10. State Design Pattern
11. Strategy Design Pattern
12. Visitor Design Pattern
13. Null Object Pattern
